Reportedly only ran for one term as senator because he dislikes campaigning. Is considered a bit of a loose cannon: Before joining office, he said things like "Jane Fonda can kiss my ass. I wouldn't walk across the street to watch her slit her wrist" and that affirmative action is "a permeating state-sponsored racism that is as odious as the Jim Crow laws it sought to countermand."</dd>

Is a union buster: eliminated collective bargaining for state workers and compared union members to ISIS. Has supported Arizona-style police stops of Hispanics to check immigration papers. The $2 billion in tax cuts he oversaw that were supposed to spur growth in Wisconsin have instead created a $2 billion state budget deficit. Has proposed axing $300 million from the University of Wisconsin as part of his austerity program. Is a foreign policy lightweight.

In 2004, he said of same-sex marriage, "This is an issue just like 9/11. We didn't decide we wanted to fight the war on terrorism because we wanted to. It was brought to us. And if not now, when? When the supreme courts in all the other states have succumbed to the Massachusetts version of the law?"</dd>
