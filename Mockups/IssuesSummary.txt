\f0\fs24 \cf0 Abortion is a woman\'92s unrestricted right\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi720\ri720
\cf0 Abortion is medical procedure terminating a human pregnancy. It was banned in 30 states until 1973. Currently, all states must allow abortions in early pregnancies but may ban them in later trimesters. People who are strongly in favor believe abortion is an important part of women\'92s health rights and reproductive freedom. Some may believe abortion is against their beliefs but clinic access should be unfettered since other women may choose differently. Although some restrictions are acceptable, abortion should be pro-choice. On the other hand, people who are opposing believe fetus is a human being. And the rights belong to the fetus, not the mother. \

\cf0 Absolute right to gun ownership\
	In the US two-thirds of all gun deaths are suicides and in 2010 there were 11,000 firearm homicides. In 2014, 21 states passed laws that expanded the rights of gun owners allowing them to possess firearms in churches, bars, schools, and college campuses. The federal government has not passed any gun control measures since the 1994 Brady Bill and 42 states now allow the possession of assault rifles. People who are strongly in favor believe the right to bear arms is a basic Constitutional right and the democratic principle of self-defense against government. People who agree think gun ownership should not be restricted since most gun owners use them safely with responsibility. Gun-related crimes should not be reduced though restricted gun ownership but address the moral problems of society instead. The other side believe registration rules should be tighten and keep guns away from kids. More guns mean more killing. \
\
Avoid foreign entanglements\
	 US was born out of deep entanglement in international affairs, extracting its independence during the tension between Britain and France. From military forces in Iraq, Iran, and etc. to commitment to Africa for food & medicine, until today, US was always in the middle of many international affairs. Some people strong favors noninterventionist foreign policy and other do not. \
\
Comfortable with same-sex marriage\
	On June 26, 2015 the US Supreme Court ruled that the denial of marriage licenses violated the Fourteenth Amendment of Constitution. It made same sex marriage legal in all 50 states. While people supporting this statement think neither governments nor corporations have any right to decide about sexual preference, others who disagree believe homosexuality is immoral and marriage is something between a man and a woman.  \
\
EPA regulations are too restrictive\
	United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was created for the purpose of protecting human health and the environment. It began operation in 1970. There were several controversies over certain environmental regulations. While EPA has been criticized for its lack of progress toward environmental justice, EPA faces many limitations to enforcing environmental justice. Some people consider animals have inherent rights and nature has inherent value, while others think human needs to come first. \
\
Expand ObamaCare\
	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA or ACA), known as Obamacare, is federal statutes signed into law in 2010. It grants the federal government significant regulatory powers and price controls over US medical service providers and insurance companies. Its goal is to give more Americans access to affordable, quality health insurance, by expanding public and private insurance coverage. People in favor believe too few Americans have adequate health insurance and government should provide coverage. On the other hand, while more thorough health coverage is a noble idea, some believe nationalized health care would entail a government takeover of a large portion of the economy thus health coverage should be promoted through non-government means. \
\
Expand the military \
	In 2015, US military spending is projected to be 54% of all federal discretionary spending, around $600 billion. People in favor thinks it is an obligation to maintain a strong military as the leaders of the world. It is important to consider carefully before making cuts. In contrast, people who oppose think military budget should be cut and pull US troops out of Europe, Japan, Korea, and elsewhere. It is wrong to have a military that is as large as the rest of the world combined. \
\
Higher taxes on the wealthy\
	Some strongly believe in progressive income tax and the wealthy should contribute proportionally more than those with lower incomes. Some other people believe a flat tax would simplify the entire tax system and get rid of loopholes that drive tax-avoiding behaviors. \
\
Keep God in the public sphere\
	In 1993, the federal government passed the federal Religious Feedom Restoration Act to protect Native Americans in danger of losing their jobs because of religious ceremonies. Strong believers think belief in God is what America was founded upon; therefore, tax funding religious organizations, praying in school, etc. does not violate the separation of church and state. The Pledge of Allegiance should continue to include the phrase \'93Under God\'94. Yet, the other group of people believe those actions fail to recognize American pluralism and religious diversity. Separation of church and state precludes allowing those actions. \
\
Legally require hiring women & minorities\
	Some people think that until blacks, woman and other minorities are proportionately represented in the upper classes of the economy and the workplace, society owes them a hand up. The government should prosecute companies, which discriminate against women and minorities. The opponents believe government should not enforce Affirmative Action. It may even be described as Reverse Discrimination. \
Make voter registration easier\
	Some considers that in order to reduce the influence of moneyed interests, reforms are needed in campaign finance. Public funds should be used for political campaigns. However, others believe that campaign donations are free speech, and should not be limited for corporations nor for individuals. \
\
Marijuana is a gateway drug\
	Currently, US law bans the sale and possession of all forms of marijuana except Washington and Colorado, where both opened the first legal marijuana markets in 2014. And many other states are preparing for legalization of marijuana. People in favor think drug use is immoral and the Drug War should be fought in all means. Others believe medical marijuana should be legalized. And people strongly oppose this say that Drug War should be ended just like how alcohol Prohibition was ended.\
 \
Pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens\
	Every 93 seconds a baby is born to illegal immigrant parents, and that child is immediately deemed a US citizen. And through many other means, there are numbers illegal aliens granted with citizenship every year. Strong supporters believe immigration restrictions are basically racist because they keep out non-white populations. Social services should be offered to all residents regardless of immigration status and immigration quotas should be changed. On the other hand, objectors think only legal immigration should be maintain. Some who strongly opposes think immigration laws should be strictly enforced by increasing border patrols and removing all social benefits given to current illegal immigrants. Immigration itself should be decreased too.\
\
Prioritize green energy\
	As of July 2013, nearly 4% of all electricity generated in US is produced by wind turbines. And farmers can earn up to tens of thousands of dollars per year in tax credits by installing wind turbines. People who are pro-green energy think overuse of fossil fuels cases serious problems. With stricter regulations such as  raising carbon taxes,  government should fund research into alternative and sustainable energy resources. And others believe cost of dealing with global warming is far higher than the potential damage, only minimal financial commitments should be made for now. And some even think there is no such thing as global warming, it is all natural climatic variation. \
\
Privatize Social Security\
	Some people are for privatize social security. They thinkg retirement funds should not be entrusted to the government. Instead, the entire social security system should be run. Opponents believe Social Security should remain under federal control to ensure all Americans have a secure retirement. The Trust Fund should not be invested in anything like stock market, due to risk. \
\
Stimulus better than market-led recovery\
	The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 was passed to boost the US economy and to avert a recession. People who agree say the federal government should inject a much funding as need to recuperate from the Great Recession, including direct federal job creation, while others think it is federal government is the cause of the Great Recession thus keeping out of the economy will end it. \
\
Stricter punishment reduces crime\
	Currently 58 countries worldwide including US allow the death penalty while 97 countries have outlawed it and some countries do not execute the penalty even if the law allows death penalty. Strong believers of this statement think mandatory sentencing and strict enforcement make sure that judges don\'92t let off criminals too easily. But opponents think the death penalty should be abolished as \'93cruel and unusual punishment\'94.\
\
Support & expand free trade\
	People agree to free trade say the government has no right to make restrictions on imports or exports. And Free trade should be national interest since it provides economic growth and jobs. Nevertheless, there are people think free trade only poses a risk to job security and causes humanitarian problems overseas. Americans should buy from other Americans because that creates American jobs. \
\
Support American Exceptionalism\
	American Exceptionalism is the theory that the United States is inherently different from other nations. It does not necessarily imply superiority, but there are some neoconservatives promoting its use in that sense. Strong supports think US should withdraw from international institutions such as the United Nations. In general, the US should consider her own national interests first, and act with other nations in accordance with those interests. In contrary, opponents think multilateralism is more effective and the US is just one country among hundreds. The US should not throw weight around, instead, should use \'93soft power\'94 and seek other non-military solutions.\
\
Vouchers for school choice\
	School voucher is a government- funded voucher redeemable for tuition fees at a school other than the public school. People in favor think the government should not be in the business of running schools. Vouchers should pay for privatel-run education at private schools, charter school, or any schools parents choose. It is not fair if only the elites are able to afford private school and the poor are stuck in failing schools. However, the opponents think public schools are an important component of American society. Funds should be used to improve public schools rather than destroying them with vouchers. With better public education, parents will choose public schools eventually.\
